/*
 * Lab 7 part 1 answers
 * 
 * Question 1
 * The busiest time of the day is at 18:00
 * 
 * Question 2
 * private Person[] people;
 * 
 * Question 4
 * The hourCounts variable is used in the fields section, in the constructor
 * and in the first two methods. The square brackets is used very often.
 * 
 * Question 5
 * 1. []int counts;
 * The brackets should come after the type not before the type
 * The correct version: int [] counts;
 * 2. boolean[5000] occupied;
 * You cannot specify the size of an array when declaring it
 * The size should be assigned when creating the array using new.
 * Correct version: boolean [] occupied = new boolean[5000];
