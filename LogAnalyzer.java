/*
 * Lab 7 part 1 answers
 * 
 * Question 1
 * The busiest time of the day is at 18:00
 * 
 * Question 2
 * private Person[] people;
 * 
 * Question 4
 * The hourCounts variable is used in the fields section, in the constructor
 * and in the first two methods. The square brackets is used very often.
 * 
 * Question 5
 * 1. []int counts;
 * The brackets should come after the type not before the type
 * The correct version: int [] counts;
 * 2. boolean[5000] occupied;
 * You cannot specify the size of an array when declaring it
 * The size should be assigned when creating the array using new.
 * Correct version: boolean [] occupied = new boolean[5000];
 * 
 * Question 7
 * 20 string objects
 * 
 * Question 8
 * The 50 is in parantheses its supposed to be in brackets.
 * 
 * Question 9
 * Hours in a day are 0 to 23. The loop using <= tries to access hour 24,
 * which doesn't exist. We should use <.
 * 
 * Question 11
 * Incorrect parameter types it was written double instead of double[])
 * Missing type of index declaration
 * Incorrect loop condititon it was written <= instead of <
 * 
 * Question 14
 * Yes the method works it gives the total.
